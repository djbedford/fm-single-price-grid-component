## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - A utility-first CSS framework

### What I learned

I used CSS grid to build out the responsive layout and help me complete it this challenge so I had to learn about how Tailwind CSS implements the CSS grid feature, this has allowed me to dig deeper in to Tailwinds' documentation and gain a stronger understanding of Tailwind CSS.

### Continued development

I would like to continue looking at using CSS grid to implement responsive layouts in future projects.
